Dear ${PERSON1_NAME} and ${PERSON2_NAME},

The birds have sung and Cupid has made his circles around you two! Looks like you are indeed a match made in heaven.

Now comes the exciting part - it is up to you to take things from here!
Perhaps exchange phone numbers, Facebook profiles, or Snapchats, then set up a quiet coffee date, an exciting movie night, or go out on a refreshing Saturday hike - anything that tickles your fancy.

We wish you all the best in this newfound relationship!

With love,
TigerCrush
